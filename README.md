# Test-IntuneFirewallRules

Test-IntuneFirewallRules is a utility to detect errors in Intune firewall rules definitions.  Common errors such as misspelled variable names, typographical errors, and unsupported configurations may lead to the rules not being imported during Intune device sync. This utility queries Intune Graph API to test creating each rule locally so that administrators can easily identify problematic rules.

## Prerequisites

Test-IntuneFirewallRules requirements:

* AzureAD or AzureADPreview module must be installed.  You will be prompted to install the module if it is not present.
* Internet connectivity
* Windows 10 or Windows 11 test device (does not need to be domain-joined or enrolled in Intune)
* The logged in account must be a member of the local administrators group.
* The script must be ran in an elevated PowerShell window so that test firewall rules can be created.

## Description

This utility will evaluate firewall rules from the Intune portal to evaluate common errors such as invalid paths and unsupported environmental variables.

Test-IntuneFirewallRules examines JSON data exported by [EndpointSecurityPolicy_Export.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/master/EndpointSecurity/EndpointSecurityPolicy_Export.ps1) in the [Intune Graph Samples](https://github.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples) GitHub repo.  Each firewall rule is evaluated on the device the script is ran from to detect errors in rule logic or exceptions reported by the Defender Firewall client.

Errors are recorded in Test-IntuneFirewallRules_Errors.*log file and an FirewallRuleTests.html document in the %temp% folder. The HTML document is displayed when the script completes.

## Usage

Test-IntuneFirewallRules must be run as a local administrator.  Your Intune/AAD credentials must allow at least read access on Configuration Policies.

There are two main modes:  Automatic and Script Ingestion.  

To run in **Automatic mode**, run Test-IntuneFirewallRules.ps1 with no additional command-line parameters. In this mode, the script will authenticate to Azure AD, export your Intune firewall rules to JSON files in %temp%, and then evaluate rules.

**Script Ingestion mode** is primarly for use by Microsoft Support.  In this mode, first run [EndpointSecurityPolicy_Export.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/master/EndpointSecurity/EndpointSecurityPolicy_Export.ps1) in a temporary folder to export all JSON files.  Provide these files to Microsoft Support. Copy the files to a test VM and run the script from the folder where the JSON files are located.  In this mode, Test-IntuneFirewallRules.ps1 does not connect to AAD and tests rule creation locally.  This is ideal for scenarios where you do not wish to create rules on a production workstation.

When the script finishes, it will show an HTML report automatically.![HTML report created by Test-IntuneFirewallRules.ps1](https://github.com/markstan/Test-IntuneFirewallRules/blob/main/Resources/results.png)

## Precautions

It is highly recommended to run Test-IntuneFirewallRules on a test virtual machine running Windows 10 or Windows 11.  The VM does not need to be enrolled in Intune.


**Warning:** Test-IntuneFirewallRules creates test rules to validate the information stored in Intune.  These rules are created in a **disabled** state, and the rule name is prepended with ____MSTestRule_DeleteMe____ to make it easy to distinguish.

At the completion of the script, Test-IntuneFirewallRules deletes any rules it creates and logs the result.  You can verify that there are no artifacts remaining in Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security MMC by examing the Inbound Rules and Outbound Rules sections. Click the **Name** column to sort alphabetically.  Any rules created by the tool are easy to identify and can safely be deleted.  Note the name and also that the *Enabled* check box is unselected to identify these rules (for example, if the device was rebooted in the middle of running the script):

## Command Line Arguments

* **-RuleJSON** - test one or more JSON files exported by [EndpointSecurityPolicy_Export.ps1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoftgraph/powershell-intune-samples/master/EndpointSecurity/EndpointSecurityPolicy_Export.ps1) .
* **-DeleteTestFirewallRules** - Clean up any firewall rules created by running the script.  Rules are automatically deleted at the end of script execution; this option is only for scenarios such as accidentally closing the script or rebooting during script execution.
* **-AcceptEULA** - bypass EULA check for automation.

## Examples

### **Test-IntuneFirewallRules.ps1**

Automatically downloads and tests all Intune Firewall rules.

If JSON files are present, this syntax will prompt you if JSON files are present in the current folder and then test the files on the local device.

### **Test-IntuneFirewallRules.ps1 -RuleJSON _path_to_JSON_file.json**

Test only rules contained in a single JSON file.

### **Test-IntuneFirewallRules.ps1 -RuleJSON c:\temp**

Tests all JSON files in c:\temp.

After the script runs, 3 files are created:

* Test-IntuneFirewallRules_*.log - debug log for this tool

* Test-IntuneFirewallRules_Errors_*.log -  Text version of error log.

* FirewallRuleTests.html

All files are located in %temp%.
